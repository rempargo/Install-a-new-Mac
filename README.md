**Install homebrew**

Homebrew is an packagage installer that will help you installing a lot of programs right from the command line. So type in *terminal* in your spotlight (âŒ˜+space) and hit the following code.

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

*source: [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)*

Now you can install many needed programs straight from the terminal.
Here are some defaults for most people.

    brew update
    brew install gnupg gnupg2 (needed for rvm)    
    
Special for me
    brew install ssh-copy-id
    brew install imagemagick --build-from-source --with-quantum-depth-8

I don't like the Dock in screen

    defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES
    killall Dock

Doesn't seen to work on **macOS Catalina**
    This makes the tiles really small, but still there
    
    defaults write com.apple.dock tilesize -integer 1; killall Dock               # This makes the tiles really small, but still there
    defaults write com.apple.dock static-only -bool true; killall Dock            # Only active apps, to make it smaller
    defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0; killall Dock   # Can't make it disappear, so make it fast
    defaults delete com.apple.dock;  killall Dock                                 # Set back to defaults
